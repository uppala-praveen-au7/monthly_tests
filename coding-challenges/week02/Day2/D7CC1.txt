1) In python, the size of float and integer is the same in terms of bytes then how is it able to store such large values?

ans:
Eventhough , both integer and float are of 32 bits wide their use and their representation is entirely different.

For example an integer cannot represent a number like 12.234

In an integer all the bits are used to store the numerical value. This is done based on 2's complement of a number.
This basically means we store numbers from -2**31 to (2**31)-1

Where as in a float, those 32 bits are divided between three distinct parts
1) 1bit - for sign of the number
2) 8bits - for the exponent of the number
3) 24bits - for the mantissa of the number
This mantissa is multiplied to 2 to the power exponent part (2**exponent part)
through which float can diplay a wider range of numbers

therefore you can store much higher values as float than in integer, eventhough the both have 32 bits to store data
